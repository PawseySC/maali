# Overview

Maali is the successor to the iVEC Build System which was developed by Chris Bording, Chris Harris and David Schibeci with the assistance of the entire Pawsey Supercomputing Team. It was originally developed to be a light-weight process for installing software on fornax, Pawsey's commodity GPU linux cluster. Due to it's successful use on fornax, it was extended to be used on epic, fornax's larger brother, an all-cpu commodity linux cluster.

The maali build system is currently used to manage system-wide software installation on all Pawsey Supercomputers: which includes two Cray XC systems (magnus and galaxy) and a SGI linux cluster (zeus). Maali can be considered iVEC Build System 2.0, and the ongoing development of maali is now open source.
